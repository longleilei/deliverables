                <h2>Aim</h2>
                <div>Recent applications of blockchain technology have fundamentally transformed the financial industry, including the domain of foreign exchange and cross-border payments. And although currently the distributed ledger technology cannot substitute the existing SWIFT model in short order, it definitely presents a potential in a long-term perspective. Considering the opportunity to decrease the number of intermediaries, to enhance transaction speed, efficiency and transparency, financial institutions also actively investigate and test blockchain solutions, however, such aspects as security and integrity, transaction performance, are yet to be addressed. Therefore, the main objective of our project is to examine the application of the distributed ledger technology for cross-border remittance, and use our key findings in building the web application.</div>
